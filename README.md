Space Combat, a micro game where you only have two interactive elements:

* Talharion Energy Cells that can be used every 10 seconds to boost your ship's shields by 500 points
* The "Start Combat" button

Yeah, I don't think it's overly interesting from the end-user's perspective, but it was never supposed to be.

I created this to have a reason to mess around with javascript. I feel like I have a pretty good understanding of the basics (I didn't really have any major problems while making the micro game), but I'm probably far from best practices and optimal solutions :laughing:.

The energy cell icon was taken from here:

I know the icon is off center but I don't care enough to fix it lol. Do check out the website though, there are lots of truly amazing icons and I love the style :heart_eyes:.
